# Brief Introduction
These repositories contain algorithm code recorded during the process of learning basic theoretical array signal processing. New code will be uploaded randomly. Just for my interest...^_^ xixixi.

Show the list of existing code :
- DOA estimation based on PAFARAC model 

- DOA estimation using Fourth order cumclant (MUSIC-like Algorithm)

- Refreshing...
